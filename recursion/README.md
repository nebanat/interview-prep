## Recursion 

**Keypoints**

- A recursive function must have a base case
- Change state and move towards the base case
- Must call itself 

**winding and unwinding**

**Tips and Tricks**
- choices: Do I go left or right? which item should I try first? e.g. permutations
- Superlatives: Biggest, longest, shortest etc. 
- Divide and conquer: e.g. binary search
- Space and time complexity

- Space complexity: O(depth)
- Time complexity: O(branches^depth)

- Trust and merge
- Damage and Repair
