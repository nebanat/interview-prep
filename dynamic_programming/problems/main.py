# memoization strategy 
# 1. make it work 
# - visualize it problem as tree
# - implement the tree using recursion 

# 2 make it efficient 
# - add a memo object 
# - make sure the object is shared among your recursive calls
# - add a base case to return memo values
# - store return values into memo
