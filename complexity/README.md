## Algorithm Complexity - Big O Notation

When things get really big which algorithm is faster period. 

### key takeaways
- Always determine the variables n, k etc.
- Drop the constants for e.g. 2n^2 + 3n + 4 = n^2
- Include all the things even if you didn't write them 
- Define variables you need 
- Add runtimes when one step is done then another
- Be thoughtful of when you add or multiply runtimes 
- Ignore the non-dominant terms for e.g. 2n^2 + 3n + 4 = n^2
